<h1> How does it work? </h1>

<p>Conventional ridesharing isn’t for everyone.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most services are not flexible. You have to plan ahead, and if your plans change last minute, chances are you won’t find another ride in time.
<li>There’s too much work. You have to update all your trips manually, and some services require you to maintain a separate social network.
<li>Most importantly, it’s hard to find people you can trust. How much do you really know about someone before they get in a car with you?
</ul>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>What if you could…</p>
<ul>
<li>Ride with only people you can trust.
<li>Find a ride on an as-needed basis a few hours before you need to head out.
<li>Automatically update your travel plans by simply using your existing calendar.
<li>See the relevant travel plans of friends and connections on Facebook and LinkedIn so you’d know who to talk to about getting a ride.
<li>Get notified when relevant ridesharing opportunities are posted.
<li>Be matched on rides with people you’d like to meet…
</ul>
Well, YOU CAN!
