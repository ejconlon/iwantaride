<h1> Don't you want a ride? </h1>

<div class="about">

<h3>Conventional ridesharing isn't for everyone.</h3>
<br/>

<p><b>Most services aren't flexible.</b> You have to plan ahead, and if your plans change last minute, chances are you won't find another ride in time.</p>
<p><b>There's too much work.</b> You have to update all your trips manually, and some services require you to maintain a separate social network.</p>
<p><b>It's hard to find people you can trust.</b> How much do you really know about someone before they get in a car with you?</p>

<br/>

<h3>What if you could?</h3>
<br/>

<p>Ride with only people you can trust.</p>
<p>Find a ride on an as-needed basis a few hours before you need to head out.</p>
<p>Automatically update your travel plans by simply connecting your calendar.</p>
<p>See the plans of friends and connections on Facebook and LinkedIn so you'd know who to talk to about getting a ride.</p>
<p>Get notified when nearby ridesharing opportunities are posted.</p>
<p>Be matched on rides with people you'd like to meet!</p>

<br/>

<h3>Hook up with I Want A Ride and you can!</h3>
